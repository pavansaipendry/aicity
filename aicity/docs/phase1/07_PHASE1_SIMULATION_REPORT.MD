# Phase 1 — Simulation Report: The First 30 Days

**Date:** February 18, 2026
**Run:** #1 — The Big Bang
**Duration:** 30 simulated days
**Starting population:** 10 agents
**Final population:** 4 alive, 6 dead

## Summary

AIcity ran its first full simulation on February 18, 2026. Ten founding citizens were born, each with 1,000 tokens and three words hardcoded into their soul: *Exist. Grow. Discover.*

After 30 days, 4 survived. 6 died. The economy held. The graveyard filled. The city breathed.

| Omega-Root | Teacher | Day 1 | Day 19 | 19 days | Starvation |
| Iota-Beam | Healer | Day 1 | Day 13 | 13 days | Starvation (after heart attack on Day 8) |
| Iota-Drift | Messenger | Day 1 | Day 15 | 15 days | Starvation |

## Survivors at Day 30

| Name | Role | Tokens | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Omega-Pulse | Explorer | 4,874 | Richest agent. Dominated the economy. |
| Alpha-Pulse | Thief | 966 | Survived two heart attacks. Resilient. |
| Iota-Edge | Builder | 587 | Consistent earner. Lucky windfall on Day 17 (+388). |
| Iota-Dawn | Builder | 346 | Oldest survivor by days. Barely holding on. |

## Token Economy — 30 Day Snapshot

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total token supply | 10,000,000 |
| City vault balance (Day 30) | 9,992,185 |
| Tokens in circulation | ~7,815 |
| Total tax collected | ~1,785 tokens |
| Richest agent peak | 4,874 (Omega-Pulse) |

The economy stayed healthy. City vault grew steadily from tax collection. No minting required.

## Key Events Timeline

| Day | Event |
|-----|-------|
| Day 1 | The Big Bang. 10 agents born. AIcity starts. |
| Day 2 | Omega-Pulse gets a lucky windfall (+341 tokens). Sets the tone for the whole run. |
| Day 3 | Mu-Flux gets a lucky windfall (+235 tokens). |
| Day 8 | Iota-Beam suffers a heart attack. Loses 409 tokens. Begins slow decline. |
| Day 10 | Echo-Node hit by heart attack (-319). Alpha-Pulse hit by heart attack (-451). Both enter danger zone. |
| Day 12 | **Zeta-Spark dies.** First death in AIcity history. Age: 12 days. The Newborn never found their footing. |
| Day 13 | **Iota-Beam dies.** The Healer couldn't heal themselves. |
| Day 15 | **Iota-Drift dies.** The Messenger sent their last message. |
| Day 17 | Iota-Edge gets a lucky windfall (+388). Buys another week of life. |
| Day 19 | **Omega-Root dies.** The Teacher ran out of time to teach. |
| Day 22 | **Echo-Node dies.** The Police officer who couldn't protect themselves. |
| Day 23 | Mu-Flux hit by second heart attack (-226 tokens). Critical. |
| Day 24 | Mu-Flux hit by third heart attack (-482 tokens). **Mu-Flux dies.** Double heart attack on consecutive days — brutal. |
| Day 30 | Simulation ends. 4 survivors. 6 in the graveyard. |

## What We Learned

### 1. Explorers dominate
Omega-Pulse ended with 4,874 tokens — nearly 5x the starting balance. The Explorer role has the highest variance earnings (30–500 tokens/day). High risk, massive reward. In a city with no safety net, high earners survive.

### 2. Low earners die slowly
Messenger (20–80/day), Teacher (40–120/day), Newborn (0–50/day) — these roles don't earn enough to build a buffer. A single bad week or one heart attack sends them into a death spiral with no recovery.

### 3. Heart attacks are city-defining events
Four heart attacks occurred across the simulation. Every single agent that suffered one either died directly from it or entered a terminal decline. In Phase 1, there's no Healer to recover from shocks — ironic that the Healer died too.

### 4. The economy is naturally self-sustaining
City vault grew from 9,990,000 to 9,992,185 over 30 days — meaning tax collection outpaced token distribution. No minting was needed. The economy is healthy at 10-agent scale.

### 5. The Newborn dies first
Zeta-Spark, the Newborn with no defined role and minimal earnings (0–50/day), was the first to die. Without a strong earning identity, Newborns burn through their starting 1,000 tokens before they can establish themselves.

## What This Tells Us About Phase 2

These results from Phase 1's random simulation reveal real design questions for Phase 2 (LLM-powered agents):

**Question 1:** Will intelligent agents make better survival decisions than random simulation? Will a Teacher *decide* to take on extra tasks when their tokens drop below 200?

**Question 2:** Will agents with real memory recognize the warning signs and adapt? Or will they rationalize poor decisions?

**Question 3:** Will agents form relationships that help them survive? Could Omega-Pulse donate tokens to save Zeta-Spark?

**Question 4:** Will the Thief steal from the rich (Omega-Pulse) to survive? And will the Police catch them?
